# Breast Cancer Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The KNN algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this case, it analyzes the features of breast cancer tumors to predict whether they are malignant or benign.
